conditions:
----------
usally condtions we write:

if(expression){
    this is will run if expression is true
}
else {
    this expression will run if expression is false
}

In terraform they wrote like this

 expression ? "this will run if true" : "this is will run if false"
  example:
      instance_type = var.environment == "dev" ? "t3.micro" : "t3.medium"
